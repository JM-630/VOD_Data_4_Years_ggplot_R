# Overview
The following R code allows the user to extract the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) data found within geotiff files. The code then converts the data into a dataframe using the latitude and longitude of the desired location, before averaging the VOD data for each month throughout a four year span. The code then displays the VOD data as a time series graph using the ggplot2 package in R.

# Output
![VOD Data over Four Year Span in Switzerland](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89235804/235256628-361f4798-4f87-4342-844d-8a1a9f5142b1.png)
